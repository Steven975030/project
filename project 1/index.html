    <h1 style="color: blue;">ABOUT MY SELF </h1>
<h2 style="color: black;" >Greetings! I'm Steven, a 20-year-old Computer Science enthusiast currently navigating my second year at the University of Central. Hailing from the vibrant Kenema District in Sierra Leone, my journey is defined by a blend of academic curiosity and personal interests.

    Standing tall at 6 feet three inches with a distinctive black complexion, I'm more than just a Computer Science student. When not immersed in the complexities of programming and software development, you'll likely find me engaged in two of my favorite pastimesâ€”playing video games and indulging in the epic narratives of Marvel movies. There's something uniquely exhilarating about conquering virtual challenges and diving into the cinematic universe of superheroes.</h2>
<H1 style="color: blue;">EDUCATION</H1>
<h2>As I chart my course through the dynamic world of computer science, I'm not just a student; I'm a blend of academic determination, digital adventurer, and Marvel aficionado. The prospect of merging my passions with the endless possibilities ahead fills me with excitement and purpose.

</h2>
<h1 style="color: blue;">MY HOBBY</h1>
<H2>In the realm of academics, I am dedicated to honing my skills and contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Beyond the lecture halls, I am a firm believer in the importance of balance. Video games serve as my digital playground, a space where strategy meets enjoyment, while Marvel movies captivate my imagination and offer a welcomed escape.</H2>
